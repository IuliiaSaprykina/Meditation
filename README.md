## Inspiration
The inspiration for Trail Less Traveled came from the current stay at home order during COVID-19 pandemic.
So many people are heading outdoors to escape cabin fever only to find themselves on a crowded trail. 
To help people to get some much needed exercise while practicing safe social distancing, we created an app that helps people find a trail with the lowest crowd level.
